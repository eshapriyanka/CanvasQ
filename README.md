- Designed a two-part computer vision pipeline to (1) apply artistic styles to input images, and (2) detect whether an artwork is AI-generated or human-made.
- Implemented VGG-based neural style transfer and a custom CNN for stylization, achieving high visual fidelity on Cubism-styled renderings.
- Built and benchmarked fake detection models using DINOv2 (Champion) and EfficientNet (Challenger), evaluating performance across pure and hybrid datasets with ROC-AUC and F1 metrics.
- Deployed top-performing models into a real-time Streamlit web app for live testing, enabling users to apply style transfer or detect image authenticity through an interactive interface.

- Applied best practices in PyTorch, including label encoding, normalization, early stopping, learning rate scheduling, and custom loss functions.

🎨 CanvasQ: Neural Style Transfer & AI Artwork Detection

CanvasQ is a Computer Vision application that combines **Neural Style Transfer** and **AI-Generated Artwork Detection** into a single interactive platform. The project enables users to transform images into artistic styles and analyze whether an artwork is human-created or AI-generated.

Built using **TensorFlow**, **DINOv2**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**, the system demonstrates the integration of deep learning, feature extraction, image classification, and web deployment.

## 🎨 Neural Style Transfer Workflow

1. Upload an image.
2. The image is preprocessed and converted into a TensorFlow tensor.
3. The style transfer model applies artistic transformations.
4. A stylized image is generated and displayed.

---

## 🔍 AI Artwork Detection Workflow

1. Upload an artwork image.
2. DINOv2 extracts high-level visual features.
3. Features are passed to a trained SVM classifier.
4. The model predicts:

   * Human-made Artwork
   * AI-generated Artwork
5. Confidence scores are displayed.
